				<br>
				<h4 class="readable" style="font-size: 20px">Education:</h4><br>
			</center>
				<p class="readable">I went to Chicago for schooling. I was in the Chicago Public Schooling 
				(CPS) system for elementary school and sophomore year of high school. After that I transfered into Devry University under a program called Devry Advantage Academy, which allowed me to obtain an associates degree at the same time I received my diploma. I received an associates in Web Graphic Design, which taught me how to make websites, edit pictures, and make images. 
				<br>
				My education after the fact came from self training and tutorials on the internet. Then I found University of the People. I am currently attending the university to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I put my education on hold temporarily to attend a dev boot camp which will teach me Full-Stack Development. I plan on working towards shifting my career to Software Developer so that I can create the many programs I feel are needed in peoples' day to day life.
